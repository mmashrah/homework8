The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.</p>\n            <p className=\"source\">Source: <a href =\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n        </div> \n        );\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nexport default Football;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/soccerimg.a93ea91b.jpeg\";","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport soccerimg from './soccerimg.jpeg';\n\nclass Soccer extends Component {\n\n    render() { \n        return ( \n            <div> \n                <h2>Soccer</h2> \n                <img src={soccerimg} title=\"Soccer Field\" alt=\"Soccer Field\" width=\"200\" length=\"200\"/>\n                <p className=\"isource\">Image Source: <a href=\"https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/11/23/unbeaten-south-hadley-girls-finally-capture-first-soccer-title-top-stoneham-3-0-in-d3-final/\">bostonherald.com</a> </p>\n                <p>Association football, more commonly known as simply football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played by all genders with a spherical ball between two teams of 11 players.

The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"runs\". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.</p>\n                <p className=\"source\">Source: <a href =\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n            </div> \n        );\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nexport default Baseball;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport {\n    Route,  \n    NavLink,  \n    HashRouter } from \"react-router-dom\"; \nimport Football from \"./Football\"; \nimport Soccer from \"./Soccer\"; \nimport Baseball from \"./Baseball\";\n\nclass Main extends Component { \n    render() { \n        return ( \n            <HashRouter>\n                <div> \n                    <h1>Sports</h1>\n\n                    <ul className=\"header\">\n                        <li><NavLink exact to=\"/\">Soccer</NavLink></li>\n                        <li><NavLink to=\"/football\">Football</NavLink></li>\n                        <li><NavLink to=\"/baseball\">Baseball</NavLink></li>\n                    </ul>\n\n                    <div className=\"content\">\n                        <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Soccer}/>\n                        <Route path=\"/football\" component={Football}/>\n                        <Route path=\"/baseball\" component={Baseball}/>\n                    </div> \n                </div> \n            </HashRouter> \n        );\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nexport default Main;\n","import React from \"react\"; \nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\"; \nimport Main from \"./Main\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\n\nReactDOM.render( \n    <Main/>, \n    document.getElementById(\"root\") \n);"],"sourceRoot":""}
